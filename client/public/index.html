Instead of giving money directly to campaigns, your donations are held in escrow and only delivered when specific conditions are met. This creates accountability and ensures your money goes to politicians who actually represent your interests."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
